# SQL

This repository houses my database projects.

Project 1: Library Management System
This project uses SQL and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 to create a database for a city's libraries. This database is developed to track all the necessary data for a city's libraries. Such data includes books, authors, library branches, book loans, and borrower information. Alongside the database, created stored procedures to allow for users to access common queries with ease.
